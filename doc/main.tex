\section*{Introduction}

This document presents a number of modules, each containing a coherent set of questions and exercises. Pick any module you deem interesting! If you don't like it, or it's too easy or too difficult, just switch to another. Each module has a difficulty rating, from 1 (easy) to 3 (difficult) stars. This difficulty is based on my estimate of how much experience one has with algorithms (and computer science in general). Each module also indicates the language used.

To run the software you need at least the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[Python] Python~2.7, 3.4 or newer. You can find an installation of Python~2.7.5 on CentOS~7 at \code{lxplus7.cern.ch}, under \code{/usr/bin/python}.
    \item[C++] A C++ compiler supporting C++11, such as GCC~4.8 or newer. You can find an installation of GCC~4.8.5 on CentOS~7 at \code{lxplus7.cern.ch}, under \code{/usr/bin/g++}. This should be referenced automatically by the Makefiles.
    \item[Java] JDK version~1.8 or newer. This is also installed on \code{lxplus7}, and will be picked up by the scripts.
